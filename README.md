# Hello-World
First Repository
My name is Greg and I'm taking my first steps into programming in hopes of changing careers. I started learning Python on Udacity to get my feet wet and get an initial feel for coding. I'm absolutely loving everything about it and I think I'm going to proceed by taking some online courses in C#.
